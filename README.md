# About

This is a SPA tic-tac-toe game. The objective of the game is two have a **three in a row** of your token.
Enjoy! https://doremaxime.github.io/tic-tac-toe/

## The Goals Were:

-   Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
-   Use your programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game
-   Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
-   Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
-   Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete
-   Craft a README.md file that explains your app to the world
-   Communicate with a back-end to store the state of your game.

## Technology used:

-   JavaScript, CSS, SCSS, JQuery, AJAX
-   Macbook Air
-   Google Chrome, Atom

## A User Should:

-   Be able to sign up
-   Be able to sign in
-   Be able to sign out
-   Be able to change passwords
-   Play multiple games at once
-   See her/his number of games played
-   Not have any web dev bugs

## Development

-   Spent the first 2.5 days on the game logic. Turns out I was making it more complex than it had to be and had to restart 3 times, but I kept pushing.
-   Spent about 1.5 days on DOM manipulation. Most of the bugs were relating to JQuery even though I did `try.jquery` a lot.
-   spent about 3 days on the APIs. The logins were easy but the game API was much tougher.
-   Learnt more doing this project than I did in class.
