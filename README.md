A SPA tic-tac-toe game.
It is a two player game with logins.
The objective of the game is two have a row of your token.

the goals were:
	•	Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
	•	Use your programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
	•	Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
	•	Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
	•	Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete (bonus: compete from separate devices)
	•	Craft a readme.md file that explains your app to the world
	•	Communicate with a back-end (which we'll provide for you) to store the state of your game.

Tehnology used:
  •	Javasrcipt, CSS, SCSS, JQuery, AJAX, API.
  •	Macbook Air.
  •	Google Chrome, Atom.

A user should:
  •	be able to sign up.
  •	be able to sign in.
  •	be able to sign ou.
  •	be able to change passwords.
  •	play a game.
  •	See her stats.
  •	not have any web dev bugs.
  •	want to play again.

Development:
  Spend first 2.5 days on game logic for node. HUGE TIME WASTE
  1.5 day on jquery - should practice more
  1.5 day on APIs - read more on this!
