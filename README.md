It is a two player game with logins.
The objective of the game is two have a row of your token.

the goals were:
	•	Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
	•	Use your programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
	•	Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
	•	Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
	•	Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete (bonus: compete from separate devices)
	•	Craft a readme.md file that explains your app to the world
