CHECKLIST
Go slowly and be methodical. test your changes in-browser as you write each line or so of code. Commit!! Deploy early and often.
	1.	 Sketch some rough wireframes for how the front end will look and act.
	2.	 Write out some user stories for the app. User stories are short of how a user interacts with your app, and follows the format "As a <role>, I want to <do something>, so that <some goal>.
	3.	 Model the entities in your app. Draw a diagram. Use your wireframes and user stories to drive you modeling process by asking "What 'things' are a user interacting with?"
	4.	 Create a repo that your project will use, and add a README to it.
	5.	 Create a simple front-end with HTML and CSS, and host the front end on GitHub Pages. Use your wireframes to guide your layout.
	6.	 Create the code to manage your game logic.
	7.	 Write jQuery code to handle browser interaction.
	8.	 Start communicating with the back-end using curl. Use this to begin writing your AJAX code.
	9.	 Add any additional features to your app.
	10.	 Finish your documentation. Make it high-quality.

TIPS
	1.	Break the project down into different components (data, presentation, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
	2.	Use your Development Tools (console.log, debugger, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems.
	3.	Work through the lessons in class, ask questions and schedule a 1on1 when you need to. Think about adding relevant code to your Tic Tac Toe game each night, instead of, you know... procrastinating.
	4.	Commit early, commit often. Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
	5.	Read documentation (jQuery especially) at home to better understand hwo the tools you're using work.
	6.	Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later. Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.


Objectives
By the time you submit this project, developers will have covered new ground in many of the big themes of the course:
	•	Command Line: Interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.
	•	Source Control: Managing and interacting with a git repository to store changes to code.
	•	Programming Fundamentals: Working with objects, constructors, and events, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors.
	•	Web Fundamentals: Structuring, styling, and animating documents within a browser; responding to actions your users take and the data they input into the browser.
	•	Browser Applications: Using AJAX to connect to a back-end application.
	•	Server Applications: We haven't covered a ton of server-side technologies yet (that's up next), but we learned a bit about how API endpoints work, and how to get data from them.
	•	Security: With JavaScript closures, scratching the surface of why security matters.
	•	Deployment: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment (GitHub Pages)
	•	Products and Teams: Document your code and your code repository so others understand what you've built.

Goals
At a high level, here are our goals for you in this project:
	•	Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
	•	Use your programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
	•	Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
	•	Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
	•	Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete (bonus: compete from separate devices)
	•	Craft a readme.md file that explains your app to the world
	•	Communicate with a back-end (which we'll provide for you) to store the state of your game.
You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Everyone will get a chance to be creative, and work through some really tough programming challenges to get your feet wet in the world of web development. Those who dare will have the tools to make it multi-player, and multi-device – so you can say to someone, "hand me your phone," load up the game, and play a quick round!
